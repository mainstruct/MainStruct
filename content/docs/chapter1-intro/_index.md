Human beings have always used language to describe the world, but traditional language mainly serves storytelling, emotions, and information transfer.  
When it comes to explaining **behavioral logic**, **relational dynamics**, and **subjective intention**, existing languages often feel vague and imprecise.  

**Why do we need a new language?**  
Because in daily interactions, we repeatedly face this dilemma: we want to express ourselves, but find no accurate words; we want to judge, but get stuck in vague descriptions.  
This is exactly what this chapter seeks to address.  

In this chapter, you will encounter three key sections:  

1. **Why do we need a new language?**  
   Explains the limitations of traditional languages and the necessity of structured expression.  

2. **Structural perspective and subjective stance**  
   Emphasizes “whose viewpoint is taken” and why subjectivity is the true core of cognition.  

3. **Application prospects of structural language**  
   Outlines how this language can be used in personal, organizational, and technological fields.

This chapter serves both as a beginning and as the foundation of the whole book.  
You will gradually realize:  
**Language is not a byproduct—it is the core tool that determines what you can see and what you can understand.**
