## 1.1 Why Invent a Language for Human Behavior

Every day, we deal with people: conflicts at home, games in the workplace, and the subtle atmosphere of social settings.  
These interactions often feel vague, complex, and even inexplicable. The same sentence can trigger completely opposite reactions in different listeners; the same situation can carry entirely different meanings depending on who is looking at it.  

The problem lies in this: **we lack a language that can precisely describe human behavior.**

Existing natural languages are mostly narrative, filled with emotion and ambiguity. Psychology and sociology provide concepts, but they rarely form reusable or computable expressions. Scientific methods emphasize evidence, but often ignore subjective intentions and contextual differences. As a result, we are left using words like “it feels like,” “sort of,” or “probably” to describe the logic behind behavior—without ever making it truly clear.  

This creates a universal dilemma:  
We can sense structures, but we cannot express them. We know there are patterns between people, but we cannot convert them into computable expressions. Without language, we lack tools. Without tools, every conflict or collaboration must start from scratch, relying only on intuition and experience—without systematic ways to learn and improve.  

Therefore, we need a new linguistic system: **structural language**.  
It does not replace natural language, but supplements it—helping us describe human intentions, relationships, and interactions with greater precision. Such a language must satisfy a few basic conditions:  

- **Centered on the “I”**: All judgments originate from subjective stance, not from the illusion of “objective omniscience.”  
- **Decomposable and composable**: Complex relationships must be breakable into minimal structural units that can then be recombined.  
- **Verifiable and transferable**: The same expressions must work across different contexts—whether analyzing family, workplace, politics, or social systems.  

In other words, this is not just a new “theory” for academia, but a **cognitive tool**.  
Just as mathematics allows us to calculate quantity, and music allows us to express emotion, structural language will allow us to capture and express the precise forms of **human behavioral patterns**.
