## 1.3 The Prospects of Structural Language

If Sections 1.1 and 1.2 explained why a new language is needed, and why it must be grounded in subjective stance,  
then the next question is: **What can it be used for?**

### 1. Individual Level
- **Understanding relationships**: With structural language, people can more quickly identify the “misalignment of intentions” behind conflicts, avoiding emotional disputes.  
- **Self-reflection**: By expressing situations through structural units, one can clearly see their own stance, motives, and possible biases in a matter.  
- **Decision optimization**: Converting vague feelings into structural expressions often reveals new paths of choice—beyond the binary trap of “either this or that.”  

### 2. Organizational and Societal Level
- **Management and collaboration**: Team conflicts often stem from inconsistent structural perspectives among members. Structural language makes such differences explicit, enabling higher-level coordination.  
- **Negotiation and game-playing**: In business, diplomacy, and legal negotiations, the ability to grasp the other party’s subjective stance often determines the outcome. Structural language provides a transferable method of analysis.  
- **Education and training**: Structural expression can serve as a universal training tool, helping people systematically learn “how to understand others’ stances.”  

### 3. Technology and Future Level
- **Artificial intelligence**: Current AI lacks a structural understanding of “subjective intention” when processing human language. Introducing structural language can give AI a more human-like mode of judgment in interactions.  
- **Knowledge management**: With structural expression, fragmented experiences can be transformed into searchable, transferable case libraries that support future decisions.  
- **Social system design**: On a larger scale, structural language has the potential to become a new tool of social science—describing group behavior, institutional games, and cultural differences.

In short, the significance of structural language lies not only in “seeing clearly,” but also in “being actionable.”  
It is not a doctrine that remains in abstract concepts, but a cognitive tool ready to be applied to solve problems.  
In the future—whether in personal growth, organizational operation, or technological development—its applications will be indispensable.
