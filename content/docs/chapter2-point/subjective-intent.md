## 2.2 Subjective Intention in the Point Structure

Although the point structure is an “undifferentiated” whole, it is not a passive blank.  
Within every individual’s cognition, the point structure is always accompanied by an initial driving force—**subjective intention**.  

Key features of subjective intention:

- **Precedes judgment**: Intention exists before we begin to divide things into “yes/no” or “good/bad.”  
  For example, when you feel hunger, all perceptions are oriented toward the distinction of “edible or not,” rather than unfolding at random.  

- **Filters perception**: Intention determines which line you cut out of the point structure.  
  In a meeting, if you come with the intention of “proving yourself,” you will be more sensitive to signs of doubt or rejection.  
  If you come with the intention of “collaboration,” you will more easily notice support and opportunities.  

- **Generates direction**: The point structure itself has no inherent meaning; meaning is assigned by intention.  
  Intention acts like the first stroke of a brush on a blank canvas, initiating differentiation.  

Thus, the point structure is never “static.” It is always in a state of potential activation by intention.  
The same external stimulus may be split into completely different structures depending on the underlying intention.  

Examples:

- A red light at an intersection means “obstruction” to someone in a hurry, but “an opportunity to rest” to someone tired.  
- The same facial expression may signal “caring” to a lover, but “provocation” to a competitor.  

Intention decides how the point structure fractures.  
It is the first driving force that carries us from an **undifferentiated whole** into the **structured world**.  

In other words:  
Without subjective intention, there is no structure.  
The point structure and subjective intention are an inseparable starting pair in human cognition.
