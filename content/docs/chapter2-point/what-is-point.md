## 2.1 What Is a Point Structure

In the earliest state of human cognition, nothing has yet been distinguished.  
At this stage, what we face is not “Object A” or “Object B,” but a vague and undivided whole.  
We have not yet cut it apart, nor assigned it meaning.  

This **undifferentiated state** is what we call the **point structure**.  

The point structure has several core features:

- **Indistinction**: Within the point structure, there is no division between “good” and “bad,” or “inside” and “outside.”  
- **Unlabeled**: Things have not yet been named, so no judgment exists.  
- **Potentiality**: It is not emptiness, but a starting point that can split into distinctions at any moment.  

For example:  
A newborn opening their eyes for the first time does not immediately distinguish “this is my mother’s face, this is the wall.” In their perception, all input is still an undivided whole. Only with accumulated experience do boundaries like “person” and “object” begin to emerge on top of the point structure.  

From the perspective of structural language, the point structure is the **zero-dimensional unit cell of cognition**.  
It does not represent any concrete state, but rather marks the **starting point of all judgment and differentiation**.  

The significance of understanding the point structure is this:  
All subsequent structures (line structures, surface structures, volumetric structures) must grow from here. If we do not acknowledge the existence of the point structure, we cannot explain **why the same external stimulus generates completely different judgments in different individuals**.  

In other words, the point structure is:  
**The original stage of subjective cognition—the source of all structures.**
