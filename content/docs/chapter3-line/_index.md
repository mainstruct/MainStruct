description: "Line Structure is the first dimension of cognition, emerging when the undifferentiated whole is split into polarities. It enables judgment, but also exposes the limits of binary thinking."

Line Structure marks the first leap in cognition.  
It cuts through the point structure and creates the most basic axis of opposition: **yes/no, good/bad, safe/dangerous**.  
From this moment on, the world becomes something that can be judged.  

This chapter unfolds in three parts:  

- **3.1 Formation of Polarities**  
  Explains how the point structure, once activated by intention, splits into the first binary dimension.  

- **3.2 Judgment Mechanism of Line Structure**  
  Describes how cognition uses this one-dimensional axis to locate stimuli and make rapid decisions.  

- **3.3 Limits of Line Structure**  
  Analyzes how binary outcomes oversimplify reality and distort complex, multi-layered situations.  

The significance of line structure is twofold:  
It gives us the first sense of direction,  
but also traps us in an either/or framework.
