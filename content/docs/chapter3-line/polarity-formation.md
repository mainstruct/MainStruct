## 3.1 Formation of Poles  

When the point structure is activated by subjective intention, the first step is not to produce complex, multi-dimensional distinctions.  
Instead, it splits into the most fundamental form: **two poles**.  

In other words, the transition from an “undifferentiated whole” to a differentiated cognition always begins with a binary.  

### Why binary?  

- **The minimal unit of judgment**  
  When we encounter a stimulus, intention forces us to choose between “yes / no,” “good / bad,” or “present / absent.”  
  This is not the result of reasoning, but the cognitive instinct to produce direction.  

- **Energy efficiency**  
  The brain saves effort by defaulting to binary judgments. Compared to multi-choice processing, a yes/no evaluation enables rapid reactions and prevents overload.  

- **Establishing reference**  
  A state cannot be recognized without its opposite. We perceive temperature only through “hot / cold,” and detect noise only through “quiet / loud.”  

### Examples  

- In primitive environments, “edible / inedible” was the most direct polarity.  
- In social interaction, “hostile / friendly” was the earliest distinction.  
- In everyday life, “to act / not to act” forms the most common choice.  

### Significance in structural language  

In structural language, this binary split from the point marks the **emergence of line structure**.  
It signals a new dimension: expanding from a zero-dimensional whole into a one-dimensional boundary.  

**In one sentence:**  
The formation of poles is the first leap of cognition from “undifferentiated” to “judgable.”  
It slices the world in two, giving us the first sense of direction.
