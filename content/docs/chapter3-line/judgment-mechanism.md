## 3.2 The Judgment Mechanism of Line Structures  

Once the point structure splits into two poles, human cognition enters the line structure.  
The core function of the line structure is to **make judgments and locate meaning between two extremes**.  

### Basic Principles of the Line Structure  

- **Principle of Opposition**  
  A line structure always relies on two opposing poles, such as "good/bad" or "safe/dangerous."  
  All perceptions are evaluated along this line.  

- **Mechanism of Comparison**  
  Judgment is never isolated; it depends on contrast between the two poles.  
  We do not simply say “this is cold” — we perceive “cold” through its opposition to “hot.”  

- **Directional Choice**  
  When positioned between two poles, the individual chooses which side to lean toward, depending on their subjective intention.  
  For example: the same criticism can mean opportunity to someone who “wants to grow,” and threat to someone who “wants to avoid.”  

### How the Line Structure Operates  

1. **Establishing a Coordinate**: An intention activates a line (e.g., “edible/inedible”).  
2. **Placing the Stimulus**: External input is positioned somewhere along this line.  
3. **Forming a Judgment**: The individual decides their course of action based on that position.  

### Examples  

- **Survival level**: Wild fruit is judged as either “edible” or “inedible.”  
- **Social level**: A colleague’s behavior is interpreted along the line of “supportive/hostile.”  
- **Emotional level**: A single phrase can be heard as either “caring” or “offensive.”  

### Significance for Structural Language  

The line structure takes us from the undifferentiated whole into a **dimension of judgment**.  
It provides the first cognitive axis, allowing individuals to act quickly and impose an initial order on the world.  

**In one sentence:**  
A line structure is a **binary judgment coordinate system**, where subjective intention determines direction.
